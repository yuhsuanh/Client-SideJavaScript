             <h2> A Semester In Review </h2>
             <p> 
                 Well COMP1073 Summer 2020 class, we're now in Week 11 and it's time to review before the final exam! We've learned quite a bit, from syntax basics, to how to debug. From working with the DOM and events to getting to know a bit more about objects and the importance of objects in this object-based language. </p>
            <p>
                We finished up with a look at APIs and how we can supercharge our websites and applications with the inclusion of APIs. We now know that APIs can be built-in to the browser, or supplied by a third-party. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Throughout the semester, you've been building your skills and also building your to-do list application. Now that you have completed Phase 2, you should now have a fully functioning To-Do list app wtih optimized code and some fancy extras courtesy of a Third Party API and a Browser API.
