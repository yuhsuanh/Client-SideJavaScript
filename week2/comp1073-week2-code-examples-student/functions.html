     <h3> Functions  </h3>
     <p> Functions are blocks of code that we create so that they  are reusable throughout our programs. This allows us to write code that is concise and DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself).</p>
     <p> There are built-in browser functions that we can use that we do not need to define. We'll come to realize that these are actually methods, BUT we'll call them browser functions for now.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
     <p>We can also create our own custom functions in order to achieve the custom functionality that we need. When creating custom functions we need to first define the function and then call it (fancy term is 'invoke') so that it will run when we want it to. </p>
     <p>Our custom functions can have names (called a named function) or may be an anonymous function.</p>
