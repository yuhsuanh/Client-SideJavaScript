<h2> Important Event Concepts </h2> 
  
  <ul>
  
    <li> <em>Event handler</em> : code that runs when an event happens (usually a function defined by the developer) </li>
    <li><em>Registering an event handler </em> : the term used when we define a block of code that will run when the event happens </li>
    <li> <em> Event Listener </em> : sometimes used interchangeably with event handler (although these two work together). An event listener listens for an event to occur </li>
  </ul>
