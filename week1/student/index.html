  <h2> JavaScript Basics </h2>
  
  <h3>Variables</h3>
  <p> Variables are like baskets or container for holding our data. The data in our variables could be anything, from numbers to arrays to objects. When working with variables, we first need to declare the variable and then we can assign it a value. We can also update that value later on in our script. There are three ways to declare a variable (var, let & const) and each one is a little different.</p>
  
  <h3> Data Types</h3>
  
  <p> There are several different data types we can work with including: strings, numbers, arrays, objects and booleans. </p>
  
  <h3> Math </h3>
  
  <p> We can perfom mathematic operations using the full-featured set of math functions availble in JavaScript.</p>
  
  <p> When doing mathematic operations with JS, there are several mathematic operators we can use. There are also comparison operators, assingment operators and decrement and increment operators available. </p>
  
  
  <h3> Strings & String Methods </h3>
  
  <p> Strings are pieces of text. We differentiate strings from other data types by enclosing them in quotes (either single or double - you choose!). </p>
  
  <h3> Arrays </h3>
  
  <p> Arrays are useful because they allow us to store more than one piece of data. They help make our code more compact and efficient. Arrays can hold any type of data, including arrays. We can access the different pieces of information stored inside our array by referencing the index number of that item. </p>
